# Requirements Engineering

It's about finding out what is needed for the project, by turning vague and defined needs or problems into clear statements about the project's vision and understanding the required properties of the solution.

## Main challenges of RE

- Making sure **communication** works, while dealing with implicit knowledge that may be misunderstood
- Requirements are constantly changing and growing, so there's the need to manage evolving, complex ideas while you implement new features
- **Requirement creep**: uncontrolled changes and continuous, never-ending growth in a project's requirements 

## Types and sources of requirements

That are two main **types** of requirements:

- **Functional Requirements**: describe the functions that the software is to execute (also known as capabilities)
- **Non-functional Requirements**: technical issues that may constrain the solution (such as hardware performance, etc.)

When it comes to the **sources** of these same requirements:

- **Stakeholders**: the ones that are interested in the product being developed, or that will be affected by it. They may be customers, end users (the ones who use the system), managers... overall, they are any **client** that could have an impact on the choices that are being made for the sake of the product.

# RE Process

There are many activities that happen throughout this phase:

- **Elicitation**: contact the stakeholders and other sources to find what is needed and discover possible requirements
- **Analysis**: organize and assess the collected information (for completeness, consistency, clarity, etc.), in order to arrive at a prioritized list of agreed requirements
- **Specification**: working on detailed documentation on what are the requirements of the system
- **Validation**: making sure the requirements that were outlined achieve the project's business objectives 

These steps are displayed via the different **artifacts** that are produced during this process, such as: list of requirements (which is **mandatory**), system models, UI interfaces or mockups and acceptance tests. Driven by **user stories**, we iterate on these four activities and we tackle what's left on our **product backlog**, that contain the prioritized list of requirements.

# Use Cases and User Stories

They encapsulate the objective of the project. They are the embodiment of the user's necessities, expressed via either a paragraph explaining what they want (**user story**) or a simple diagram that shows the linking between different actions triggered by their behaviour (**use cases**).
