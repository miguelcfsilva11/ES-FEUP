# Software Project Management

There are different project stakeholders when it comes to a software engineering project. While developing its core, there are few actors that take part in the project's vision:

- **Project Sponsor**: pays for its development
- **Project Manager**: makes a decision on the direction that the project will follow
- **Project Management Team**: aid the decision explained above and have influence on such matters
- **Project Team**: develop the project according to the defined vision

## The Iron Triangle

There are three main aspects when it comes to the project's management.

- **Scope**: its features and functionalities
- **Schedule**: the way time is organized
- **Resources**: budget needed, understanding the costs

These should contribute and amount to the project's overall quality.
