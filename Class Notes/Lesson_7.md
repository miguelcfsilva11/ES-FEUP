#  Behavior Modeling in UML

You can describe a system's behaviour using various kinds of UML diagrams, such as:

- **Sequence Diagrams**: use cases, scenarios, interactions between a set of participants in a given context
- **State Machine Diagrams**: useful for discrete event-driven behavior, modeling the lifecycle of objects
- **Activity Diagrams**: shows the hierarchical
decomposition of a non-atomic behavior

## SCRUM

SCRUM is an agile framework to support, sustain and deploy products in a complex environment. Its foundation feeds on *Trust*, *Focus*, *Transparency*, *Courage*, *Respect*, and *Commitment*.

There are three main roles:
- **Team**:  *cross-functional*, typically 5-9 people, with members who work full-time, and that only leave / join between sprints.
- **Scrum Master**: project's manager, ensures team is fully functional, responsible for enacting Scrum values and best practices
- **Product Owner**: define product's features, reviews work results, responsible for product's outcome.

While practising Scrum in a team's environment, you should organize work in *short cycles*, dont let management interrupt the team during a work cycle, make good estimations of work, measure your own performance and define work goals through *user stories*.
