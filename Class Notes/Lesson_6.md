# Construction and Evolution

**Simplicity** is one of the key concepts to keep in mind while developing software. Through communication, you achieve the following principles:

- **KISS**: Keep it Simple, Stupid
- **YAGNI**: You ain't gonna need it

With that said, it is advisable that we implement the simplest design possible at any given moment. When the need of change arises, we *refactor* it.

## Integration

- It should be **continuous**, without ever compromising test results
- It should be **consistent** and **frequent**

The **Evolution** of every piece of software eventually reaches a new phase by the name of **Servicing** - that consists in changing or fixing stuff without adding new functionalities. Project's **Phase-Out** cycle means stop changing the code or fix past features.

## Maintenance

There are three types of maintenance:
- **Fault Repairs**: Correct functionalities in order to meet the requirements
- **Environmental adaptation**: Adapt software to different operating environments
- **Functionality Modification**: Adding or modifying the system to meet new requirements

In a quick note, **refactoring** also happens in a form of maintenance (**preventative maintenance**).
